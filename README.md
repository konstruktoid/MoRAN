MoRAN
===========

MoRAN is minimal web interface created to manage [RANCID](http://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/) devices present in router.db.
You update or insert a device by searching for an existing one, and then edit the attributes. If you change the device name, a new device will be added.
The cron script then exports the devices and generates a RANCID router.db file used by control_rancid.
